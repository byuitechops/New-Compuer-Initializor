# New-Compuer-Initializor

Download all the files and then run the "Initialize.bat" File as "Administrator". To do this, right click the file and select "Run as Administrator" Follow the prompts as they come.

### Please Note
If you run the program and windows throws a windows defender alert or something prompting you to not run the file, hit "More Info" and select, run anyways.

It is **important** that you wait for the installers to finish before moving on in the prompts. 
Also, you need to extract the folder from the zip file in order for it to be able to run and execute properly. 

Please pay attention to **capitalization**. It will open and close several windows on it's own, but please keep up with the prompts. 

If a blue bar appears at the top of the Command Prompt Window, that just means that something is being downloaded.
